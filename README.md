# Bar-Prehim-Nasa-Space-App--2021

Here we represent our project named Blitz Learn.
We think this project is exceptional for this competition.

Our Problem is  Identifying the risk with science and communities.

We're attempting to address the major issue in a variety of ways. Our goal is to send out a message with a risk prediction and warning, as well as increase awareness about the Landslide.

According to scientists, the landslides root reasons are:  

Slope, 
Aspect,
Relative relief 
Plan curvature
Geomorphology
Geology
Distance Drainage
Rainfall 
Deforestation 
EarthQuakes
River filing 

Everything is not by nature. Some of the reasons are happening for humans. Those are,


Hill Cutting
Uncontrolled Construction
Deforestation
Sand Mining. 

We are gathering all attribute data from the NASA dataset. Using this data, we developed a supervised machine learning and deep learning system that predicts landslides on our desktop and mobile apps. With our app, we show every property in its current state, including forestation and rainfall data visualization. First and foremost, we display the danger of landslides based on divisional regions in our application. Then we show distinctive features such as slope, forestation, rainfall, and aspect, among others, so that individuals and government policymakers may understand which sectors require greater attention. People may view the situation in their own location as well as for the entire country of Bangladesh. When we click on Chittagong, for example, we are sent to the Bangladesh risk map, where Chittagong is located in the critical zone. Landslide causes, including rainfall, deforestation, and urbanization rates, are visualized using data from Chittagong. Finally, we used all of the data to discover the predicted landslide using machine learning and deep learning techniques. This is a sample of our Android app.
Local residents will be able to identify specific locations affected by the landslide based on this visualization. We may not be able to eliminate all landslide-related losses, but we may minimize them by lowering the sources of landslides that are linked to high-risk rates, such as deforestation and urbanization. To raise awareness, we created Knowledge to Survive, an educational 2D game. Which game will teach you what you need to do about landslides and what you don't need to do about them? If we make the wrong decision we will be facing landslides. If landslides are not prevented, we will be aware of the consequences. These actions will raise public awareness and decrease the chances of landslides.




 
Our Technical Solution:

We're getting data from NASA's EOSDIS Land Data and NASA's Earth Science Data Systems Geographic Information Systems Team (EGIST), as well as Google Earth. 
The application's crowdsourced data should provide the rest of our data.
 All of the data from the Python API is converted to JSON and then to HTML.




The Output of this Project:

1 . Local people will be aware of landslides and get continuous real time updates.
2.  From that specific visualization people and governments may take operations specifically to prevent or reduce loss from landslides.

3. Deforestation rate warning. 
4. Urbanization rate increases warning to people and government. 
5. To prevent landslides, people or the government to do tree plantation, river digging and other will reduce climate change also. 



Future Plan:

We will keep our app updated & more features will be added Soon. We want to use augmented reality to visualize data  & the damage status.
